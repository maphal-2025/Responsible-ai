# Responsible-ai

 **Assignment Brief (student-facing)**

You’re now a **Responsible AI Inspector 🕵️‍♂️**. Your job is to investigate how AI is used in a scenario, spot anything suspicious (bias? lack of transparency?), and help fix it. You'll be given 2 short cases.

Your mission:

Describe what the AI is doing.

Spot what could go wrong (hint: check fairness, privacy, accountability...)

Suggest 1 way to improve it responsibly.

🎨 Bonus points if you write your answer like a short **blog post** explaining the issue in a fun and clear way.

Think of it as being a detective — but make it **vibe**.
